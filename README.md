Technical Description:

Efficient Workflow:
DevOps Practices: This project has embraced DevOps principles to enhance collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. The implementation of version control, continuous integration, and continuous deployment has been a cornerstone in streamlining the software development lifecycle.

Jenkins Integration: Jenkins pipelines have been configured to automate crucial stages of the development process, including building, testing, and deployment. This integration minimizes manual intervention, ensuring a consistent and reliable software release process.

AWS EC2 Optimization: The project leverages AWS EC2 instances for scalable computing resources. This optimization allows for dynamic provisioning of infrastructure based on application demand, leading to both cost-effectiveness and improved performance.

Dockerfile for Containerization: Dockerfile is employed to containerize applications, promoting uniformity across different environments. This containerization strategy simplifies deployment on diverse platforms, providing consistency in application behavior.

Automation Expertise:
Node.js Automation: Automation scripts using Node.js have been developed to create robust workflows, enhancing overall efficiency and reducing the likelihood of errors in repetitive tasks.

Workflow Integration: Automated workflows seamlessly integrate into the development process, ensuring consistent and efficient execution of tasks such as testing, code linting, and deployment.

Integration Testing: Automated integration tests have been implemented to validate the interoperability of various components. This contributes to improved code quality and reduces the time required for manual testing.

Containerized Deployment:
Dockerfile Optimization: Dockerfiles have been optimized to create lightweight and efficient container images. This approach minimizes resource utilization, accelerates deployment, and enhances overall system performance.

Resource Management: Container orchestration tools, particularly Kubernetes, have been employed for efficient resource allocation, load balancing, and automatic scaling. This ensures optimal utilization of computing resources in dynamic and complex environments.

Create AWS EC2 instance using Ubuntu:
The provided commands demonstrate the setup of an AWS EC2 instance using Ubuntu, including the installation and configuration of Jenkins and Docker. Jenkins is utilized for automation, while Docker facilitates containerized deployment of applications.

Required Commands to run:-

Jenkins Installation:
1.	curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \   /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null 
2.	echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \   https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
3.	sudo apt-get update 
4.	sudo apt-get install jenkins
5.	sudo systemctl enable jenkins
6.	sudo systemctl start jenkins
7.	 sudo systemctl status jenkins
8.	 sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Docker Installation:
1.	sudo apt install docker.io
2.	CMD ["node","app.js"]
3.	docker build . -t node-app
4.	sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
5.	docker run -d --name node-daily-app -p 8000:8000 dailytracker-node-app

Got to jenkins job and Execute shell:
1.	docker build . -t node-app-dailytracker
2.	docker run -d --name node-app-container -p 8000:8000 node-app-dailytracker

Note: Ensure that the commands are executed with the appropriate permissions and configurations in the target environment. Additionally, the Jenkins initial admin password is crucial for the initial setup and should be handled securely.
